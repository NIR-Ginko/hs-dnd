## Introduction

This repository is my attempt to hone Haskell 2010 skills along with
studying to play (and playing of course) Dungeons and Dragons since I
know no one who's willing to play it in my community.

I found it interesting applying Haskell to solving tasks with lots of
math like DnD calculations. Maybe I'll try to add some Final Fantasy
mechanics in the future to make it a little bit more interesting.
